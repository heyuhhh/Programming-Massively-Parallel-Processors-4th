# Introduction

**[2024/3] Subsequently some summary of some common CUDA operators are provided. You can refer to: [CUDA-Learning](https://github.com/heyuhhh/CUDA-Learning)**

This repo is used to record the code written in the process of learning \<\<programming massively parallel processors fourth edition\>\>(PMPP 4th), which mainly includes the core code of the examples in each chapter.

The first 15 chapters have been completed so far. There are no plans to expand the content of subsequent chapters, but some expansion or optimizations will be added to the previous content.

**[2024/3] 后续对一些常见的cuda算子进行了一些总结，可以参考：[CUDA-Learning](https://github.com/heyuhhh/CUDA-Learning)**

本仓库用于记录学习 \<\<programming massively parallel processors fourth edition\>\>(PMPP 4th) 过程中写的代码，主要包括每一章节示例的核心代码

目前已完成前 15 章的内容，暂不打算扩展后续章节的内容，但会对前面的内容做一些扩充或优化
